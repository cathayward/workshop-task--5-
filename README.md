# workshop-task--5-

### workshop task reflection:

website: 

- it was really hard for me to come up with a concept for what to do with my data as i have never been particularly good with graphs and/or tables
- there were a lot of issues in the headers which i beleive to have been caused by the fact that my headers had spaces in them, once that was rectified, most of the code seemed to be working well.
- i decided to use the statistics from my top 5 songs of the past 7 days on spotify, collecting the data form my [last.fm](http://last.fm) account.
- i couldn’t really think of anything too creative to do with the data so i decided to represent it randomly on a canvas
- if i had the time, i would add extra data sets from other weeks to see if i could cover the whole canvas with my listening, or even adding more songs than just my top five but i feel it could get too complicated quickly.
- though it it isn’t my best work, i really struggled to think of anything too interesting due to the personal restrictions i feel surrounding data
- maybe if i had some different data that could be represented in a more exciting way i would have come up with a better idea, but for now i like what i’ve done and i think it is an accurate representation of my spotify listening over the last 7 days
